# MashrahAOddOrEven



Review: Elizar Garcia, code runs great! Tells me if my numbers are even or odd. Code is clean and easy to follow. The only thing I would suggest is adding a .ToLower to the playGameYes = Console.Readline, cause if I answer in all caps it breaks the code. Other than that the game runs great! Great job!
